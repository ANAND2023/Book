    <p>As he turned around, he saw James running towards
“base” and darted after him. Just before
he touched James’ shoulder, James tagged the “base”
and yelled out “SAFE!” “Did you get Sally yet?”
James asked. “No,” said Mark.
“I haven’t been able to find her and it’s getting late and
we need to be heading home.”
<br/>
<hr/>
So both boys yelled out
“Come on out Sally, it’s late.”
But there was no reply.
Not even a little snicker from
somewhere in the darkness.
They yelled again.
“Come on out Sally, it’s late.”
Still there was no reply from Sally.
They began to worry and started searching for her. As they walked around the area they called out “Sally, come on, we give up; you’re safe.”
But no matter where they looked,
or how much they called out,
<br/>
Sally was wondering what had happened.
All she could remember was
crawling under the big trunk
of a fallen tree to hide.
Now, as she looked up, she saw
several stars through a small hole above her head.
She had fallen into a hole
when she crawled under the tree trunk.
“Help!” she yelled and heard her voice
echo throughout what must have been a cave.
“HELP! Help, help, help!”
